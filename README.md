Its  is a basic chat game .where user is suppose to play with the words and it decides his chances to win or lose.

I got the user interface for the web from our other course .
and i have updated thAt to my own horror story and used it to deploy on heroku .

So as you view the game , you will have to basically type any word such as hi hello to start yout game and than u will get a chance to choose the option as in this way game continous and at some point on base of your selection you win or loose the game .
and than game end as you win or loose .

After that as you type again hii you will start a new game.

this code of word game is wrritten in node.js and has a beautiful interface of chat app.

it is kind of horror story chat game where u win or loose on bases of your selection.

Thanks:) hope u enjoy the game:)
BEEST OF LUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
